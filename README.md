Hello Roman,

I've added a new script to the iotaf project that enhances the user experience with the following features:

1. **Dynamic Breadcrumbs**: The script generates breadcrumbs dynamically based on the user's navigation, providing a clear path of their journey through the content.

2. **Watched Status Tracking**: Users can now easily keep track of which content they have watched. The script marks items as 'Watched' or 'Not Watched' and updates their status accordingly.

3. **Navigation Helpers**: The script includes functionality to find the previous and next items in the menu, allowing users to navigate through content sequentially with ease.

4. **Styling Enhancements**: It applies custom styles to various elements such as status labels and buttons, improving the visual hierarchy and readability.

5. **Dark Mode Support**: The script also supports dark mode, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience in different lighting conditions.

6. **Responsive Quiz Layout**: Lastly, the quiz sections are now more responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for a better user interface.

I hope these features will make the iotaf experience more intuitive and user-friendly.

Edson Henrique.
